= Python audio processing suite =

This Python module contains a variety of convenience functions to
process audio signals.

It is free software distributed under the GPL version 3.

You can find the latest news and versions of this software at:
  http://projects.rudd-o.com/python-audioprocessing

== What it requires ==

Your computer must have these software packages:

 1. Python
 2. SciPy
 3. NumPy (python-numeric)

All major distributions include these packages, either as default or
in their package manager repositories.  You can get these things in
a matter of minutes, so there's no excuse not to use this software.

== How to get and install it ==

There are three ways you can get Radio jockey:

=== Official, ready-to-install release for your distribution ===

Find it [/radio-jockey/downloads on the releases page].  Install it
using your distribution's package manager.

=== Official, buildable source package ===

Get the compressed tape archive on [/radio-jockey/downloads on the releases
page].  Install it using [http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html Python's distutils].

=== Latest code, directly from our Git repository ===

Clone [/radio-jockey/git/ our Git repository] to get the latest snapshot
of the source code.  You can [/radio-jockey/browser inspect the repository]
online too.
