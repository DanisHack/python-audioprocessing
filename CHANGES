Version 0.0.5:

* Reorganized the code into separate submodules
* Implemented a streaming model that does not require decoding of the
  entire file and does not use temporary files
* Boosted song analysis performance by 2X with the streaming model

Version 0.0.4:

* Tuned default parameters for optimum correlation coefficients
* Cleaned up the library, splitting graphing into a separate workbench module
* Added more options to the command-line programs
* Documented some functions, fixed some bugs
* The API remains unchanged, but it will change in the future

Version 0.0.3:

* Added the ability to plot signatures in 3D (spectral analysis)
* Added a batch operator that can store the results in a GDBM database
* Removed butterscotch-correlate to be replaced in the future by a better
  alternative

Version 0.0.2:

* Changed default signature to 32 bands [0..11025] and 12 10-second samples
* Changed correlation functions to return correlation average
* Verified with threshold 0.9 - correlation works reliably as duplicate identifier
