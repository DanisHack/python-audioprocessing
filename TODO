Things to do:

* there is a bug in the wave module -- mono files's .getnchannels() method returns 2
* write an algorithm that combines the phase beat detector and a time-domain beat detector
  for best results, and write a program that uses it and writes the TBPM tag on mp3
* now that we know the FFT code is solid, we can perhaps apply the bark scale to get the
  appropriate buckets from the FFT, so we can compare songs
* for a song comparison plugin for Amarok, think about the database structure that will
  contain the signatures and also cached correlations between them
* make a set of command-line tools that allow to analyze and cache those results, then
  perform correlations, right from the command line, without the need for Amarok or
  programming expertise

* practice fadvise or find a way to decode an mp3 through pipes, sigpipe or stop the
  decoding as soon as it gets to a certain amount of data, read the data chunked, and
  also correctly determine sample rate (mpg321 pipe fails to do correct sample rate
  on several input songs)
* reduce RAM usage by loading chunk-by-chunk instead of the whole 2 minutes in RAM


Algorithm tasks:

* we need to explore several axes of the problem via correlation and graphs, to:

  - increase the accuracy of correlation (same versions of the same song should
    have very high correlations, anything else should have a drastically lower
    correlation coefficient)
  - make it faster (*anything* to make the correlations faster, even at the expense
    of making the analysis slower)

  I'm now exploring:

  * the optimum num. of bands (8, 64, 512)
  * log / linear bands
    Generating large amounts of linear bands and then log-averaging them to very few
    log bands should be much faster than comparing lots of bands
  * dB / linear intensities
    Not very gung-ho here, last time I tried that, correlation coefficients for similar
    songs went to the tank.

  I need to set up several experiments, one axis per aforementioned option, select several
  pairs of songs already known to be similar and mark them, perform the autocorrelation
  for each experiment, and visually compare which experiment yielded an acceptable
  precision and analysis time.
